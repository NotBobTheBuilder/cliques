Cliqu.es
========

A tool for managing groups on trips.


### Organiser problems:

- Hard to keep track of where people are
- People get lost often and need directing
- If badly prepared, can be hard to get in touch with people

### Attendee problems:

- Easy to get separated from group & find them again
- Not always clear how to contact organiser.


## Solution

Service for keeping locations of attendees in one place for trips, and allowing people to contact each other.

## Workflow

Organiser creates a 'trip', can add members by

1) Phone Number
2) Email
3) Directing to website, where they can join nearby groups

People separated from group can request member locations and get routing information to them

1) Sending SMS to organiser for their location
2) Falling back to all attendees who can share theirs
3) Using a webrtc/twilio call to speak to organiser

Organiser can set checkpoints on map & times to be there

Organiser can send messages to all attendees
